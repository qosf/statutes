# Volunteer titles at QOSF

CV have always been important and LinkedIn has become very important in our day and age. We get it and you should be able to indicate that you've worked or volunteered with us.
However, we want to streamline this process and ensure fairness. No one should just invent random job titles and abuse the Quantum Open Source Foundation for their personal gain.
With this document we would like to define some basic rules in order to streamline this process going forward.

## Where to add your QOSF affiliation

On LinkedIn, there are three different subsections on your profile:
- _Experience_,
- _Education_, and
- _Volunteer experience_.

QOSF is a Canadian not-for-profit and all of the work you've been doing with us is considered volunteer work.
Hence, **please only add your QOSF affiliation to the _Volunteer experience_ section on your LinkedIn profile**.
We kindly ask you to **not** add it to the _Experience_ section since this incorrectly implies that you were employed by QOSF.
The same applies to your personal CV - only add your QOSF affilation under the _Volunteering_ section.

## Titles

The following is the list of official volunteer titles that we use at QOSF. **Please do not use any other title on LinkedIn or on your personal CV**.

This title implies that you were part of the original team that conceived the
idea of the Quantum Open Source Foundation, incorporated it and subsequently
build it up from scratch. There are only three people holding this title and

Core team members attend our regular bi-weekly QOSF team meetings and have
assumed ownership of one or more of our initiatives. All of our core team members are listed

considerable amount of their free time in order to mentor one or more quantum
